      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <h2>Trading Basics: </h2>
      <p><strong>alt.bet</strong> allows you to make predictions on future events either by buying or selling
        contracts in the probable outcome. Each outcome has a probability between 1 and
        99 percent. We convert those probabilities into monetary values in real accounts
        and virtual currency in free accounts.</p>
      <p>For example, a bettor thinks in sporting event ( in this example, Manchester United
        vs. Chelsea) has at least a 75 percent chance of Manchester United to win so he or
        she offers 75 cents for a contract. <strong>alt.bet</strong> matches bettor’s offer with that of another
        bettor, who is willing to pay 25 cents per contract or a chance of Chelsea to win.
        Each trader now owns number of contracts in the market for this event on opposite
        sides.</p>
      <p>The prices of contracts will change over time as probabilities change and both
        bettors could decide to buy or sell their units at any time. A key to success at <strong>alt.bet</strong>
        is knowing when to buy and sell in order to take a profit or prevent a loss.</p>
      <p>If ManU wins, its contracts are redeemed at $1. Chelsea’s contracts become
        worthless. If ManU does not win before the market closes, bettors holding contractsin Chelsea will be paid $1, while Maun U contracts will be worthless.</p>

      <h2>Choosing Markets</h2>
      <p><strong>alt.bet</strong> offers four markets on its platform. These are sport, e-sport, economic and
        socio-political events.</p>
      <p>Every market asks a specification about a potential future event. Some markets
        feature events that have simple outcomes based on these specifications, while
        others offer multiple possible outcomes. Each of these events are known as a
        ‘contracts’ and priced in cents per contact.</p>
      <p>Besides main board, every event has its own page showing the latest prices and
        trading metrics available. Pay particularly close attention to the Rules and
        Specifications for each market. These describe the criteria that will be used to
        decide whether your prediction comes true or not.</p>
      <h2>Placing An Order (Bet)</h2>
      <p>Placing an order or bet at <strong>Alt.bet</strong> is no different than at a regular sportsbook. Simply click on the box
        showing the best price available, enter your desired number of units, and press BUY/SELL. The unit amount in the
        box shows the current depth of liquidity available to bet at that price.</p>

      <p>If you have order confirmation selected, you will also need to confirm your order by clicking on the ENTER
        button. You can set up bet confirmation under Account -> Display Preferences -> Review Orders Before
        Placing.</p>

      <h2>Buy (Back) and Sell (Lay) </h2>
      <p>To <strong>‘Buy’</strong> a selection in a market is to place a bet for something to happen. This is like a bet
        that you would
        place with a regular sportsbook and is explained above.</p>
      <p>To <strong>‘Sell’</strong> a selection in a market is to place a bet for something NOT to happen, or in other
        words, bet against something happening.</p>
      <h2>Example:</h2>

      <p>If you want to <strong>Sell</strong> Team Y, or back them NOT to win, the best price available is $.36. Click
        on the red box and
        your order will appear in the order pad, as below. Enter your size and press “Submit”.</p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/archive/7/74/20150204121152!%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BA_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8.gif" alt="">
      <p>If you have bet confirmation selected, confirm your bet by clicking on the Place Order <i>button</i>.</p>

      <h2>Market Exposure</h2>
      <p>One of the basic principles of <strong>Alt.bet</strong> is that a customer is only allowed to risk funds that are available in
        their account.</p>
      <p>Market exposure is the term that represents the amount of money that has been reserved to cover the unmatched
        and matched orders placed on your account.</p>
      <p>Each time you place an order (a bet), or make a change to an unmatched order, your market exposure will be
        adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>Alt.bet</strong> will also reserve funds to cover the trading fees you will have to pay once your order has been
        settled.</p>
      <h2>Trading Fees</h2>
      <p><strong>Alt.bet</strong> charges or rebates tiered trading fees when you place an order. For more information, see Trading
        Fees.</p>

      <h2>Liquidity Providers and Market Makers</h2>
      <p>In order to provide deep liquidity and ensure transparent and continuously flowing market, <strong>Alt.bet</strong> will
        facilitate its business not only to retail bettors but also to Liquidity Providers (LPs) and licensed gaming
        operators – Market Makers (traditional Booknakers)</p>
      <p>Liquidity Providers (LPs) are trading members that act as market makers by committing to provide liquidity in
        an instrument listed on <strong>Alt.bet</strong>.</p>
      <p>Liquidity Providers enhance <strong>Alt.bet</strong> markets because they protect against variations in volatility on the
        market, guarantee transactions at all times at the best price and support the volume of transactions in the
        Central Order Book.</p>
      <p>Market Makers (MMs) – are trading members who act on agency basis by routing customers’ orders to the exchange. </p>
