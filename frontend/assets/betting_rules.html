      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Alt.Bet takes every effort to ensure that betting is carried out in a fair and secure
        manner.</p>
      <p>Alt.Bet reserves the right to amend these rules as necessary.
        Alt.Bet does not accept responsibility for any errors or omissions with regard to
        event and market data.</p>
      <p>Unmatched bets are active immediately without any delay before and during the
        event.</p>
      <p>Bets are matched in price-time priority. Bets with a better price will be matched
        first. If the price is equal, bets will be matched in the order they were received by
        the Alt.Bet exchange.</p>
      <p>These rules will apply unless superseded by the Terms and Conditions or market-
        specific rules.</p>

      <h2>2. Customer Responsibility</h2>
      <p>It is the customer's responsibility to have read and accepted Alt.Bet Betting Rules
        prior to partaking in any market activity. The customer should contact
        <a href="#">support@altbet.net</a> if he or she has any questions or concerns.</p>

      <h2>3. Customer Disputes</h2>
      <p>Customers should contact <a href="#">support@altbet.net</a> if he or she feels that the Alt.Bet
        Betting Rules were not properly enforced. Any disputes will be dealt with in a
        prompt and professional manner.</p>

      <h2>4. Settlement</h2>
      <p>Alt.Bet will make every effort for bets to be settled as quickly as possible after the
        outcome has been determined. Where possible, we will rely on the official result
        publicized by the event's governing body. Otherwise, we will use publicly verifiable
        sources of information such as the BBC or Yahoo Sports.</p>
      <p>Alt.Bet reserves the right to delay settlement should the outcome be unclear or
        controversial.</p>
      <p>Alt.Bet reserves the right to void or resettle markets should new information
        become available, such as cheating or rules violations.</p>

      <h2>5. Voiding Bets</h2>

      <p>Alt.Bet reserves the right to void any markets where the outcome cannot be
        reasonably determined.</p>
      <p>Alt.Bet reserves the right to void any bet for any reason before or after the event has
        occurred. This may be due to fraud, technical error or settlement error.</p>
      <p>Alt.Bet reserves the right to recover funds that were disbursed in error.</p>
      <p>Alt.Bet reserves the right to void bets deemed to be clearly erroneous, as outlined in
        the policy here.</p>

      <h2>6. Exceptional Circumstances</h2>

      <p>Abandonments - If the event does not conclude within 36 hours of the scheduled
        time, all bets are void.</p>
      <p>Cancellations - If the event is cancelled, all bets are void.</p>
      <p>Postponements - If an event is postponed more than 36 hours from the scheduled
        time, all bets are void.</p>
      <p>Change of Opponents - If there is a change in opponents for an event, all bets are
        void.</p>
      <p>Change of Venue - If there is a change in venue, all bets are void.</p>
      <p>Periods of Time - If the length of the event is modified, all bets are void.</p>
      <p>Dead Heat - In the event that there are more winners than expected, the winnings
        will be split proportionately.</p>
      <p>Change of Surface – If there is a change in surface all bets will stand.</p>

      <h2>7. In-Play Betting</h2>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>We will attempt to suspend markets and cancel bets at the start and at the end of an
        event. However, we cannot always guarantee that a market will be suspended and
        bets cancelled in time. Therefore it is important that users manage their in-play bets
        at all times.</p>
      <p>In the event that a market is not suspended and bets cancelled at either the time of
        the start or the time of the finish of an event, we reserve the right to cancel any
        unmatched bets and/or void any matched bets made after this time. Determining
        the time of the start of the event will be in Alt.Bet’s sole discretion.</p>
      <p>Betting after the outcome of an event is known is not permitted. We reserve the
        right to void bets where a user has obtained an unfair advantage by placing bets
        after an event has occurred in a match or game (for example, by placing bets
        immediately after a goal is scored in order to take advantage of the price as it was
        before the goal.)</p>

      <h3>Markets subject to an in-play betting delay</h3>
      <p>Markets subject to an in-play betting delay are not managed. This means that
        markets will not be halted when there is a material event (for example a goal,
        penalty or red card). It is therefore important that users manage their in-play bets at
        all times.</p>
      <p>Bets submitted on an in-play market will be subject to an in-play betting delay
        before being placed into the market. The bet will also be unavailable to adjust or
        cancel until the expiration of this delay.</p>
      <p>Any increase in the stake or adjustment of the prices will be subject to the delay.</p>
      <p>Customers may be trading against API users, who are subject to different
        arrangements for in-play markets. The Alt.Bet API is made available to liquidity
        providers.</p>

      <h2>8. Football Specific Rules</h2>
      <p>All football markets apply to the standard length of 90 minutes including stoppage
        time. These markets do not take overtime or penalties into account.</p>
      <p>If a football match is not properly completed, cancelled or otherwise abandoned,
        markets will be voided, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally
        determined. (i.e. half time markets if the match is abandoned in the second half).</p>
      <h3>Types of Football Markets Offered:</h3>
      <p>Winner - This market will be settled on which team has won after regular time has
        expired or if there is a draw.</p>
      <p>Correct score - This market will be settled on the correct score after regular time has
        expired.</p>
      <p>Total goals - This market will be settled on the sum of the goals for each team during
        regular time.</p>
      <p>Half-time/full-time winners - This market will be settled on the result at halftime,
        including stoppage time from the first half, and the result at end of regular time,
        including stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Team to score in both halves - This market will be settled on the team scoring in
        regular time (including stoppage time) in both halves of the event.</p>
      <p>Half time result and score markets - These markets will be settled based on the
        result of the game when the half time whistle is blown (regular time plus any
        stoppage time).</p>
      <p>Over/Under markets - These markets will settle based on the number of goals
        scored at the end of regular time and any stoppage time. Penalties or extra-time will
        not be included.</p>
      <p>Asian Handicaps - These markets will settle based on the final score at the end of
        regular time and any stoppage time. Penalties or extra-time will not be included.</p>
      <p>First Goal scorer - This market will be settled based on which player scores first
        during regular time and any stoppage time. Bets will be voided on players who take
        no part in the match or who come on as substitute after the first goal is scored. Own
        goals do not count for this market.</p>
      <p>Draw no Bet – This market will be settled on the full time result. In the event of a
        draw all bets will be void.</p>
      <h3>Outright markets:</h3>
      <p>A season or competition is declared as started once the first game of the scheduled
        season or competition has begun.</p>
      <p>If a team is thrown out, disqualified or otherwise removed from a league, one of two
        actions will apply:</p>
      <p>If this happens prior to the relevant season starting, all bets on affected markets will
        be void;</p>
      <p>If this happens after the relevant season has started, affected markets will stand and
        the team will be deemed to be relegated and all bets on that team will be settled
        accordingly (assuming that before the end of the season said team is not reinstated).</p>
      <p>For 'Top Goal scorer' markets only the goals scored in the league or competition
        stated in the quoted division/ tournament count. For example, if a player joins a
        club during the season goals scored in a different league will not count, however
        goals scored in the same league for a different club will count. Own goals will not
        count nor will goals scored in extra-time or penalty shootouts. Dead heat rules
        apply.</p>
      <p>'Outright Winner' markets will be settled on the final position/points total of teams
        at the completion of all scheduled matches. In the event of two or more teams tying
        the result will be determined by the official result of the governing body. Dead heat
        rules apply.</p>

      <h2>9. Tennis Specific Rules</h2>
      <p>If the first set of a match is not completed, all bets related to the match will be
        voided.</p>
      <p>When there is uncertainty about the outcome of an incomplete or cancelled match,
        Alt.Bet will settle match bets according to which player or pairing goes through to
        the next round, or who wins the tournament overall if the match is a final.</p>
      <p>Any cancellation, postponement or change to the length of a tournament will void all
        bets relating to occurrences of certain events within a tournament unless the
        outcome of those markets has already been determined.</p>
      <p>Any change to the scheduled number of games or sets required to win a match, or a
        retirement or disqualification during a game or set, will void bets on affected game
        and set markets.</p>
      <p>Alt.Bets will not void bets due to changes in venue or changes in the playing surface.
        For tournament winner markets, all bets stand run or not.</p>

      <h2>10. Basketball Specific Rules</h2>
      <p>Bets are settled on the official result including overtime unless otherwise stated.
        If a game fails to start as scheduled, all bets are voided.</p>

        have elapsed in any other game, OR</p>
      <p>b) A result is determined by an official governing body.</p>
      <p>If neither of the above criteria are met, all bets will be voided, except for bets in
        markets where the outcome has already been unconditionally determined.</p>
      <p>'Outright Winner' markets will be settled as the named winner by the relevant
        governing body, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the
        result. Dead heat rules apply. All bets will stand regardless of the length of the
        season/ playoff series so long as a winner is declared.</p>

      <h2>11. Baseball Specific Rules</h2>
      <p>All bets will be voided on all markets unless both named pitchers start in the first
        innings for their respective teams.</p>
      <h3>MLB Specific Rules</h3>
      <p>Bets will be settled as their outcomes become determined. Later decisions to void
        markets will not affect earlier settled markets if the outcomes of which are
        unaffected.</p>
      <p>Matches must begin on their scheduled starting date, or be voided. If a match begins
        but is later abandoned or postponed a result must be declared within three days for
        outstanding bets to be valid.</p>
      <p>Extra innings will be included unless stated otherwise.

      <h2>12. American Football Specific Rules</h2>

        (e.g. half-time/full-time market and winning score markets).</p>
      <p>If, after overtime, there is a tie, bets on the outright match winner market will be
        voided.</p>
      <p>If a match does not start on the scheduled start date and is not completed within 36
        hours of the scheduled completion date, all bets on the match will be voided.</p>
      <p>If a match begins but is then postponed or abandoned, then within 72 hours of the
        initial start date:(a) at least 55 minutes of play must have elapsed; or (b) an official
        result must be declared. If neither of the above criteria are met, all bets will be
        voided, except for bets in markets where the outcome has already been
        unconditionally determined.</p>
      <p>For bets on the outcome of the coin toss pre-game, the market will be settled based
        on the official result.</p>
      <p>If the coin toss is repeated any number of times due to a foul throw or throws the
        official result will still be used to settle the market.</p>
      <p>'Outright Winner' markets will be settled as the named winner by the relevant
        governing body, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the
        result. Dead heat rules apply. All bets will stand regardless of the length of the
        season so long as a winner is declared.</p>
      <h3>Motorsports Specific Rules</h3>
      <p>In the event of a race being abandoned and no official result or presentation position
        is declared, all bets will be voided.</p>
      <p>All bets are voided if the location of the race is changed after the market has been
        posted.</p>
      <p>Unless a bet has an official result, it will be voided if all scheduled races or heats are
        not completed in a Speedway market.</p>
      <p>In match markets, the winner is the rider or driver who has finished ahead or
        completed the most laps.</p>
      <p>If the settlement of a market relies on a podium finish and no podium presentation
        occurs, the market will be settled according to the official result.</p>

      <h2>13. Ice Hockey Specific Rules</h2>
      <p>Bets placed on “Regular Time” markets will be settled according to the score at the
        end of regular time. Any points scored during overtime or shootouts are not
        included in regular time.</p>

        any shootouts played. Other handicap markets on other matches will be settled at
        the end of regular time, excluding overtime and shootouts.</p>
