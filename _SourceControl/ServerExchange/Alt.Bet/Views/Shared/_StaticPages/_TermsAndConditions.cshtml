            <h2>Definitions. </h2>
            <p>
                Exchange and Asset are created when an event is scheduled to occur. An Asset may be one or more Contracts which can
                be bought or sold at any point before the conclusion of an Event. If you decide to sell a Contract or a number of
                Contract s which make up an Asset it will become an Order. Event means a real life event determined by Alt.Bet
                Exchange. Matched Order means the point in time at which an Order is matched by an opposite Order on the Platform.
                Order means an offer made by a user to either buy or sell a Contract relating to an Event awaiting a counter offer
                made by another user prior to such Order becoming a Matched Order. Any Order will always include the quantity of
                Contracts and the price per Contract available to be bought or sold. Reference Price means 100 cents for each Contract
                bought by a user who predicts the outcome of an Event correctly. Settlement means that if an Order placed regarding an
                Event is correct and has become an Asset, then the user who placed the Order will have their account credited with the
                relevant amount of winnings. Trading Floor means the designated area(s) on the Platform open for a specific Event and
                which contain sub Trading Floors. Such area permits users to place Orders. Subject to any other applicable provisions,
                when an Event ends, the relevant Trading Floor shall be closed to any further trading. Contract means one contract
                between users to buy an expected outcome of an Event. Contract Price means the price, in pence, that reflects the odds
                of an Event to occur or to not occur as a function of 100 cents. Wager means the number of Contracts X Contract Price.
                Portfolio gathers the range of Assets and Orders that each user holds in each Trading Floor. Your Balance Your
                available balance for betting will be calculated as follows:
                The money which you have deposited in your account
                + The money which you have won which has yet to be withdrawn from your account + Bonuses granted to you which are
                available to bet with - The money which you have lost - Orders - Commission
            </p>
            <h2>The Rules: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Once a Trading Floor is opened each user of the <strong>alt.bet</strong> is permitted to enter it.</li>
                <li>
                    Each user can bet on an Event in a Trading Floor and predict the outcome of an Event in accordance with the
                    statement presented in the Trading Floor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For illustration purposes only: If a user decides to bet on "Yes", meaning that the Event will end in accordance
                    with the statement presented in the Trading Floor:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            a) If the Event ends as the user predicted (i.e. the answer is YES to the statement presented)- the user will
                            be credited the Reference Price multiplied by the number of Contracts bought.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            b) If the Event ends not as the user predicted (i.e. t the answer is NO to the statement presented)- the user
                            will lose his Wager. If a user decides to bet on "No", meaning that the Event will not end in accordance with
                            the statement presented in the Trading Floor:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    a) If the Event ends as the user predicted (i.e. the answer is NO to the statement presented) - the user
                                    will be credited the Reference Price multiplied by the number of Contracts bought.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    b) If the Event ends not as the user predicted (i.e. the answer is YES to the statement presented) - the
                                    user will lose his Wager.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                <li>
                    If the Event is not completed and its outcome settled within 48 hours of its scheduled completion time and date for
                    any reason, the outcome of the Event will be considered as a “No” to the statement presented. By way of example
                    only: The statement in the Trading Floor is: REAL MADRID vs. BARCELONA User buys REAL MADRID WINS – the user will be
                    credited the Reference Price multiplied by the number of Contracts bought If REAL MADRID DOES NOT WIN (either Real
                    Madrid loses) – user loses his Wager.

                    <ul>
                        <li>a) Sub Trading Floor on YES- agreeing with the statement</li>

                <li>
                    In each of the sub Floors users will be presented the relevant data that are specific to that sub Floor such as

                            the Order will automatically await a Matched Order until such Matched Order occurs or until the Event is
                            completed and the Order is voided.
                        </li>

                <li>
                    Following the Contract Price being matched, the Platform will automatically seek to match the quantity of
                    Contracts requested or offered by the user:
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            sold a Matched Order will occur for the available quantity of Contract s offered in the sub Trading Floor and an
                            Asset will be created, while the remaining Contracts which do not Matched Order will remain as an Order.
