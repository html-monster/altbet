                        We collect two types of data and information from our users. The first type of information is un-identified and
                        non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via your use of the
                        Services (“Non-personal Information”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal
                        Information was collected. Non-personal Information which is being collected may include your username, aggregated
                        usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware
                        information (e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and
                        the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.), in order to enhance the functionality
                        of our Services. The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that
                        identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“Personal Information”). When you
                        open an account and register to our Services, you will be asked to provide Personal Information to us. The
                        Personal information we collect through the registration process includes your full name and gender; mobile phone
                        number; e-mail address; home address; date of birth; payment means (e.g. credit card number); and other financial
                        information that we may need in order to provide our Services. In addition, our Services enable you to share with
                        us Personal Information from your social networks accounts, such as Facebook or Google, and to register to our
                        Services through those accounts.

                        contacts list, etc.). We will abide by the terms, conditions and restrictions of such platforms. We may also
                        collect and display content, including your photo, which you voluntarily submit and upload through your use of the
                        Services (Collectively “User Submissions”). We as well as other users may see your username and the User
                        Submissions which you make publicly available through our Services. We may also collect Personal Information from
                        your device (e.g. geolocation data, IP address) and other information which relates to your activity through the
                        Services, including your betting history, betting offers viewed, your clicks and actions, etc. We may also store,
                        use or share information which does not enable identification of an individual user (e.g. Non-personal Information
                        or Personal Information in non-human readable form) in any circumstances. If we combine Personal Information with
                        Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it
                        remains combined.
