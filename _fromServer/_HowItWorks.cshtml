                        <h3>Trading Basics: </h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="http://alt.bet/" class="link_altbet">alt.bet</a> allows you to make predictions on future events either by buying or selling
                            contracts
                            in the probable outcome. Each outcome has a probability between 1 and 99 percent. We convert those
                            probabilities
                            into monetary values in real accounts or virtual currency in free accounts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, Bettor A thinks in sporting event has at least a 75 percent chance of Team X to win so he or
                            she
                            offers 75 cents for a unit. <strong>alt.bet</strong> matches Bettor A offer with that of Trader B, who
                            is willing
                            to pay 25 cents for Team Y unit. Each trader now owns number of units in the market for this event on
                            opposite sides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The prices of units will change over time as probabilities change and both bettors could decide to buy or
                            sell
                            their units at any time. A key to success <strong>alt.bet</strong>
                            is knowing when to buy and sell in order to take a profit or prevent a loss.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If Team X wins, its units are redeemed at $1. Team Y’s units become worthless. If Team X does not win
                            before the
                            market closes, bettors holding units in Team Y will be paid $1, while Team X’s units will be
                            worthless.

                            Placing an order or bet at <strong>alt.bet</strong> no different than at a regular sportsbook. Simply

                        <h3>Market Exposure</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the basic principles of <strong>alt.bet</strong> is that a customer is only allowed to risk funds
                            that are available in their account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Market exposure is the term that represents the amount of money that has been reserved to cover the
                            unmatched and matched orders placed on your account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each time you place an order (a bet), or make a change to an unmatched order, your market exposure will
                            be adjusted accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>alt.bet</strong> will also reserve funds to cover the trading fees you will have to pay once your
                            order has been
                            settled.
